# Mapping_Earthquakes

We started off this challenge with having earthquake data on two different maps and an earthquake overlay. We then took the earthquake data and added in the tectonic plates' location to add this as another overlay. We added a second overlay to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. Laslty a third "dark" view map was added.
